## Synopsis

A very simple application that shows the current day of the week in Japanese as
a tray icon.

## Motivation

I created this to help me learn the days of the week in Japanese.

It also works as a compact way of showing the day of the week if you already
know Japanese.

## Usage

Just run `japanese-weekday-tray.py`.

On Windows, you can instead run `japanese-weekday-tray.pyw` to avoid a console
window popping up. You should also configure Windows to always show the icon.

To reconfigure the font, edit the variables near the top of
`japanese-weekday-tray.py`.

## Dependencies

* Python 2
* PySide

## Supported Platforms

I have only tested it on Windows 7.

However, it should work on any platform supported by PySide with some tweaking
to account for colors, size and positioning.
